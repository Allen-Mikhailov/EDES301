# Uni-Slime

This is a desktop pet that is supposed to run around on your desk (and probably fall off)

[Hackster Page](https://www.hackster.io/mikhailovallen/uni-slime-6ca01f)

# Software build
This project requires python3.11 as well as many libraries such as
- adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
- adafruit-blinka
- numpy
- adafruit-circuitpython-mpu6050

There are instructions for how to install python3.11 and the other libraries in the "python-commands.md" file in the docs folder

# Software Opperation
There is almost no user input to this device that is required for it to do anything interesting as it supposed to be passive.
Just pull the repository into your pocketbeagle and run the run command and your good unless you want to fiddle with settings that havent been implemented yet
