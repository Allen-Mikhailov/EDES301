i) 
I have a few problems with the style guide, for one in the tabs vs spaces 
debate I am on the side of the tabs as it allows the 
user to control how big the visual indent actually is
while spaces do not allow this option. Spaces only limit 
the amount of control we have over how our code looks.

Also in the Whitespace section it states to avoid extraneous 
white space which can make the code unreadable in many cases.
I am not a fan of how they say to only use one space around 
an assignment and not to try to align it with others. 
To me this looks terrible and making sure all of the values 
are aligned can make code so much easier to read.

Also in the documentation with strings having the indent due to the 
"""looks terrible and it would look so much
better if they started writing a line after the """

Also I think inline comments can make things a lot better.

ii) 
I do not think that white space should matter that much in python. 
I often like using excess whitespace to align variables and similar
lines to make them easier to read. 

iii)
The most interesting thing I found in the style guide was the
fact that underscores have meanings other than just for an unused variable
or between words. It is also used to indicate private variables which I think
is a weird way to do it but it works. Also trailing underscores to prevent clashes
with keywords is something ive never thought to do before.
